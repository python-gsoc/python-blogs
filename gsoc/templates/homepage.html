					The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is an organization devoted to advancing open source
					technology related to the Python programming language.
					Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has participated in Google Summer of Code, serving
					as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring
					projects related to the development of the Python language. Python provides mentors, Google
					provides the program (and the money!), and students write code!

					<p>We are hoping to participate in GSoC 2019 and are in the process of gathering ideas for
						our application!  Sub org ideas pages are due Feb 4, so students can expect project ideas to be ready
						for viewing around then.
